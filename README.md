This is 37.exe a trojan created by MalwareLab150.
In Python and Assembly with 26 payloads and 7 bytebeats includes: Delete LogonUi.exe, regedit keys, disk.sys , system32 , taskmgr and overwrite the mbr.
It also has many RGB and Screen smash style graphic effects.
I RECOMMEND YOU USE A VM FOR EXAMPLE VIRTUALBOX or VMWARE, if you run it on a real PC the damage is many, for example crashing ventoy and Rufus or making the disks unreadable.
I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE.
Credit to @ArTicZera For the mbr . 
The mbr is a FULL remake of AcidOs cube
